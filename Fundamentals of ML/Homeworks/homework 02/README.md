# Comparison of Supervised methods on data with different dimensions:

# Datasets
Each category of dataset includes separate training and hold out test data.
- 2 Dimension data
- 7 Dimension data
- HyperSpectral data

hw02.py includes implementation of KNN and probabilistic generative model(regular and diagonal versions) from scratch. After defining the models, K-Fold cross validation has been used for parameter tunning using the validation data. Finally the model with best performance for each category has been used to predict the test labels properly. 

The detailed explanatioons could be found in the report.pdf. 

If you want to use this code please fork it and ask for any further changes.
