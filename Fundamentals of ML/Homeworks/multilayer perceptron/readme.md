Trained a multi-layer perceptron using backpropagation for the given two dimensional dataset. Some part of the code to implement the MLP was provided, but anything missing we code up ourselves and add it to the code. There are two python files, one with the MLP implementation (labeled mlp.py) and another for instantiating the MLP and using it (run.py). 

For the report,confusion matrices were used to demonstrate the accuracy of our MLP, and discuss the methods you used to achieve the highest accuracy. The effect of number of iterations, learning rate and number of hidden layer nodes have been investigated.
