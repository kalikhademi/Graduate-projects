Final project:Analyzing US-visa decisions by using classification and clustering methods

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-perm-visas/activity
Supervised Learning Methods: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
Unsupervised Learning Methods: PAM, Complete Linkage and Divisive method (Diana). 


Motivation
* Determine whether machine learning techniques could accurately predict visa decisions? 
* Whether biases exists in the process of visa decisions?

Research Questions
* Using different set of variables in the data set, how well can a classification model predict a visa decision (case status)?
* Are clustering techniques able to group applicants based on case status (denied, certified, certified-expired, withdrawn) in a meaningful way?
